    <head><b>How operating system work</b></head>
    <body>
<P>For desktop systems, access to a LAN or the 
    Internet has become such an expected feature 
    that in many ways it's hard to discuss an operating 
    system without making reference to its 
    connections to other computers and servers. 
    Operating system developers have made the 
    Internet the standard method for delivering crucial 
    operating system updates and bug fixes. Although 
    it's possible to receive these updates via CD or 
    DVD, it's becoming increasingly less common. In 
    fact, some entire operating systems themselves 
    are only available through distribution over the 
    Internet.

    Further, a process called NetBooting has streamlined the capability to move 
    the working operating system of a standard consumer desktop computer --
    kernel, user interface and all -- off of the machine it controls. This was 
    previously only possible for experienced power-users on multi-user platforms 
    like UNIX and with a suite of specialized applications. NetBooting allows the 
    operating system for one computer to be served over a network connection, by 
    a remote computer connected anywhere in the network. One NetBoot server 
    can serve operating systems to several dozen client computers 
    simultaneously, and to the user sitting in front of each client computer the 
    experience is just like they are using their familiar desktop operating system 
    like Windows or Mac OS.
    
    One question concerning the future of operating systems concerns the 
    ability of a particular philosophy of software distribution to create an operating system 
    usable by corporations and consumers together.
    
    Linux, the operating system created and distributed according to the principles of open source, has had 
    a significant impact on the operating system in general. Most operating systems, drivers and utility 
    programs are written by commercial organizations that distribute executable versions of their software 
    -- versions that can't be studied or altered. Open source requires the distribution of original source 
    materials that can be studied, altered and built upon, with the results once again freely distributed. In 
    the desktop computer realm, this has led to the development and distribution of countless useful and 
    cost-free applications like the image manipulation program GIMP and the popular Web server Apache. 
    In the consumer device realm, the use of Linux has paved the way for individual users to have greater 
    control over how their devices behave.
    
    Many consumer devices like cell phones and routers deliberately hide access to the operating system 
    from the user, mostly to make sure that it's not inadvertently broken or removed. In many cases, they 
    leave a "developer's mode" or "programmer's mode" open to allow changes to be made; howe3ver, that's 
    only if you know how to find it. Often these systems may be programmed in such a way that there are 
    only a limited range of changes that can be made.Some devices leave both a mode of access and the
     means of making powerful changes open to users, especially those that use Linux. Here are a couple of 
     examples:
    
    The TiVo DVR runs on a modified version of Linux. All of the modifications are public knowledge, and can be downloaded here along with some special tools for manipulating the code. Many enterprising TiVo users have added functionality to their systems, including increasing the storage capacity to getting to UNIX shells to changing the mode from NTSC to PAL.
    Many home routers also run on Linux.</P>
