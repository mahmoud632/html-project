    <h1>What is an operating system?</h1>
    <p>An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by 
        a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application 
        programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined 
        application program interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the operating 
        system through a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).</p>

        <h1>Why use an operating system?</h1>
        <p>An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development.
             Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the 
             comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, such 
             as disk storage, network interfaces and so on. Considering the vast array of underlying hardware 
             available, this would vastly bloat the size of every application and make software development 
             impractical.</p>
             <p>Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or displaying text on a standard 
                 output device, such as a display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an 
                 intermediary between the applications and the hardware. The system software provides a 
                 consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the 
                 applications needing to know any details about the hardware.</p>
                 <p>As long as each application accesses the same resources and services in the same way, that 
                     system software -- the operating system -- can service almost any number of applications. This 
                     vastly reduces the amount of time and coding required to develop and debug an application, while 
                     ensuring that users can control, configure and manage the system hardware through a common 
                     and well-understood interface.</p>
                     <h1>Functions of an operating system</h1>
                     <p>An operating system provides three essential capabilities: It offers a UI through a CLI or GUI; it 
                         launches and manages the application execution; and it identifies and exposes system hardware 
                         resources to those applications -- typically, through a standardized API.</p>

                         <p>UI. Every operating system requires a UI, enabling users and administrators to interact with the 
                             OS in order to set up, configure and even troubleshoot the operating system and its underlying 
                             hardware. There are two primary types of UI available: CLI and GUI.</p>

<h1>Operating system types and examples:</h1>
 
<p>General-purpose operating system. A general-purpose OS represents an array of operating 
    systems intended to run a multitude of applications on a broad selection of hardware, enabling a 
    user to run one or more applications or tasks simultaneously. A general-purpose OS can be 
    installed on many different desktop and laptop models and run applications from accounting 
    systems to databases to web browsers to games. General-purpose operating systems typically 
    focus on process (thread) and hardware management to ensure that applications can reliably 
    share the wide range of computing hardware present</p>
    <b>Common desktop operating systems include the following:</b>
    <ul>
    <li><P><b>windows</b> is Microsoft's flagship operating system, the de facto standard for home and business 
        computers. Introduced in 1985, the GUI-based OS has been released in many versions since 
        then. The user-friendly Windows 95 was largely responsible for the rapid development of 
        personal computing.</P></li>
<li><p><b>Mac OS</b> is the operating system for Apple's Macintosh line of PCs and workstations.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Unix</b> is a multiuser operating system designed for flexibility and adaptability. Originally 
    developed in the 1970s, Unix was one of the first operating systems to be written in the C language.</p> 
<li><p><b>Linux</b> is a Unix-like operating system that was designed to provide PC users a free or low-cost 
    alternative. Linux has a reputation as an efficient and fast-performing system.</p> 
</ul>  
    <p>Mobile operating system. Mobile operating systems are designed to accommodate the unique 
        needs of mobile computing and communication-centric devices, such as smartphones and tablets. 
        Mobile devices typically offer limited computing resources compared to traditional PCs, and the 
        OS must be scaled back in size and complexity in order to minimize its own resource use, while 
        ensuring adequate resources for one or more applications running on the device. Mobile operating 
        systems tend to emphasize efficient performance, user responsiveness and close attention to data 
        handling tasks, such as supporting media streaming. Apple iOS and Google Android are examples 
        of mobile operating systems.</p> 
<p>Embedded operating system. Not all computing devices are general purpose. A huge 
    assortment of dedicated devices -- including home digital assistants, automated teller machines 
    (ATMs), airplane systems, retail point of sale (POS) terminals and internet of things (IoT) devices -
    - includes computers that require an operating system. The principal difference is that the 
    associated computing device only does one major thing, so the OS is highly stripped down and 
    dedicated to both performance and resilience. The OS should run quickly, not crash, and handle 
    all errors gracefully in order to continue operating in all circumstances. In most cases, the OS is 
    provided on a chip that is incorporated into the actual device. A medical device used in a patient's 
    life support equipment, for example, will employ an embedded OS that must run reliably in order to 
    keep the patient alive. Embedded Linux is one example of an embedded OS.</p>
